# Weather - The Odin Project 

The weather app project from [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app),
fetches a weather api and displays the next 3 days of forecast for a user-specified city.

## Deploying:

Do all this in the main branch...

- Run `npm run build` to create the production build in dist/
- Create a commit for that release and push that to GitHub
- Run `npm run deploy` to run the git script that pushes only the dist/ folder
to the gh-pages branch, which automatically deploys to the gh-pages site.
